#Flutter Counter App with Riverpod and Shared Preferences

A simple Flutter app that demonstrates state management using Riverpod, with data persistence through Shared Preferences. The app includes a counter feature that can be incremented, decremented, and reset, with the counter value saved locally so it persists between app restarts

#Features
  -Increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.
  -Persistent state using Shared Preferences to store the counter value locally.
  -Organized project structure for better modularity and readability.
  -Two pages demonstrating how to use Riverpod for state management across multiple screens.
  -Snackbar notifications for user feedback.
